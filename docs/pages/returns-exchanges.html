            To request a return or exchange, please email
            <a href="mailto:hello@purvanti.com">hello@purvanti.com</a>
            with the following information:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Your order number</li>
            <li>The item(s) you wish to return or exchange</li>

          <h2>Return Shipping</h2>
          <p>
            Once approved, return instructions and any applicable shipping details will be provided.
            Original shipping charges are non-refundable unless the return is due to an error or damage
            on our part.
          </p>

          <h2>Exchanges</h2>
          <p>
            If you’re requesting an exchange and the replacement item is available, we’ll ship it
            once the returned item is in transit. If the replacement is unavailable, we’ll offer
            a refund or store credit based on your preference.
          </p>

          <h2>Refunds</h2>
          <p>
            Approved refunds are issued to the original payment method after the returned item
            is received and inspected. Processing times vary by bank or payment provider and may
            take several business days to appear on your statement.
          </p>
